# Rumor Detection and Analysis on Tweets
1)  Wrote Python scripts to scrape tweets using tweepy API. 
2) Developed a pipeline to conduct data preprocessing, feature engineering and rumor classification on tweets, using the BERT model from PyTorch and the ensemble classifier XGBoost. Ran 35k+ raw data with 60% labelled via GPU. Achieved 90% F1 score in the test dataset and ranked the top 16% of the Kaggle competition.
3) Wrote Python scripts to analyze rumor & non-rumor tweets regarding topic trends, hashtags, sentiment and user attributes.
